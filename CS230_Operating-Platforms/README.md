# CS 230 - Operating Platforms

This course covers the application of software design patterns through the lens of an operating system. 

## Resources 

The suggested reference books include:

- [Operating System Concepts](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operating-system-concepts/9780470128725/silb_9780470128725_oeb_toc_r1.html) 
- Hands-On Design Patterns with Java

The Hands-On Design Patterns with Java is through an account on [Vital Source](https://www.vitalsource.com/); although I must say its basically a chopped up Java rendition of [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) and a lot of the information is delivered well by [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).
